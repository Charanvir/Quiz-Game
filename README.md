The final score is the amount of time remaining once every question has been answered. If the user has set the high score, they will be asked to provide their initials to save, along with their score, into their local storage so they can view their high score at a later time. If the user does not beat the high score they will be presented their score and a button to reset the page and try the quiz again. 

The user has the ability to clear the high score from the local storage and set a new score with the next game played.
